UCD final year project: Social Network via Strategic Games

Run the efficient_Payoff.m in MATLAB, it will generate an empty network and propose edge swaps to make a social network,
when the network is generated, the second approach is used to collect all the edges, clear the network, rebuild the original network and then compare the time efficient and inefficient method take.
The efficient method requires to enter a number that how many edges you would like to give back.
